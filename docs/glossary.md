## SSH

SSH stands for "Secure Shell" and is a protocol for connecting to remote computers via your terminal. You'll likely be using it a lot as you connect to your devices (such as a Raspberry Pi) to set things up. 

## VNC

VNC stands for "Virtual Network Computing" and like SSH is a means of connecting to another device from your current computer. The difference is that you'll be connecting to remote machine's desktop GUI.
